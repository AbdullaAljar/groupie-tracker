# Groupie Tracker

Groupie Tracker is a project aimed at receiving a given API and manipulating the data contained in it to create a website displaying information about bands and artists. The API consists of four parts:

Artists: Contains information about bands and artists, such as their name(s), image, year of activity start, date of their first album, and members.
Locations: Contains information about the last and/or upcoming concert locations.
Dates: Contains information about the last and/or upcoming concert dates.
Relation: Links the artists, dates, and locations together.

## Objectives

- Build a user-friendly website to display band information through various data visualizations (e.g., blocks, cards, tables, lists, pages, graphics).
- Create events/actions that trigger actions communicating with the server to receive information.
